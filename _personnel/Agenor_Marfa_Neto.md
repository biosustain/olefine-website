Dr. Mafra-Neto, the president and CEO of ISCA Technologies, has extensive expertise in determining an insectâ€™s responsiveness to semiochemicals and in manipulating their behaviour to limit crop damage. Dr. Mafra-Neto has worked on the modification of insect behaviour using semiochemicals, both in the laboratory and in the field. On a basic scientific level, his research has included the behaviour of insects in the presence of complete and incomplete blends of pheromone at different doses, the effect of combining semiochemicals with insecticides, and on different forms of pheromone presentation and their effect on flying males.
