Mr. Jean-Pierre Princen is Global Business Developer & Experienced Executive in Agriculture & Food Technologies. Engaged in searching, developing & promoting Ag Tech Innovations contributing to a Sustainable World : more & better Food/Feed while protecting the Environment & the Natural Resources of our planet, and improving People Health.
ISCA Technologies, Inc. (Riverside, CA) is a successful, privately owned corporation whose mission is to protect the world from damaging insects and disease causing pathogens by developing tools and solutions that are economical, effective, and ecologically friendly. Its product range comprises more than 300 species-specific insect lures (made with nature identical semiochemicals such as pheromones and natural attractants), more than 20 different types of insect traps, proprietary semiochemical controlled release technologies such as flowable monolithic formulations, like SPLAT, and a range of novel pest management tools (such as smart traps that autonomously detect and identify mosquitoes, and bio-functionalized nanosensors for the detection of plant pathogens).

Dr. Agenor Mafra-Neto, the president and CEO of ISCA Technologies, has extensive expertise in determining an insectâ€™s responsiveness to semiochemicals and in manipulating their behaviour to limit crop damage. Dr. Mafra-Neto has worked on the modification of insect behaviour using semiochemicals, both in the laboratory and in the field. On a basic scientific level, his research has included the behaviour of insects in the presence of complete and incomplete blends of pheromone at different doses, the effect of combining semiochemicals with insecticides, and on different forms of pheromone presentation and their effect on flying males.
