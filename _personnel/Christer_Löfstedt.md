Professor Christer Löfstedt is head of the Biology department at LU and maintains a very active research program on insect chemical communication. Löfstedt has more than 35 years of research experience and management of large-scale research projects in this field, including studies covering the whole range from molecular biology to behaviour, field experiments, and pheromones for pest control. Löfstedt has published more than 175 original papers, including 4 in Nature/Science, 3 in Nature communications and 5 in PNAS. Major achievements of relevance to the proposed program include genetic dissection of variation in pheromone communication systems, discovery and functional characterization of genes involved in pheromone communication, metabolic engineering of plant and cell factories for insect pheromone production, development of systems for control of stored-product-pests and pests in spruce seed orchards. Löfstedt was one of the PIs launching the Centre for Genomic Ecology at Lund University and was the first director of the research school GENECO founded in 2008.
